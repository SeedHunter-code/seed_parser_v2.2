# Seed Phrase Extractor

## üîç Description

This Python 3.x program performs a recursive search for secret phrases from crypto wallets inside files. It checks their validity (i.e., prints only those phrases that comply with the BIP39 standard) and displays the passphrase along with the path to the file in which it was found. 

Validation of phrases for compliance with the BIP39 standard is performed using the library from the repository of the Trezor hardware crypto wallet.
